                The Siberian husky is a breed of working dog native to northeastern Siberia ( Chukotka , Russia ).

                This dog was created by the Chukchi tribe as a working dog to pull sledges over long distances during their hunting parties, serving as a rapid transport vehicle for prey on the way back to town.
                
                Contrary to popular belief, this breed never had a sheepdog function since the Chukchi people originally did not keep their own livestock.
                
                Due to the climatic conditions of their homelands, their fur not only served as their own protection against such low temperatures, but also gave them a place inside the tribe's tents, helping to keep the children warm at night. For this reason, the Chukchi dog (as it was originally known), was also highly appreciated (and even pleasantly recognized by other tribes), for its contribution to the family nucleus, despite being really an active working dog.
                
                Since its importation into American lands at the beginning of the 20th century, we can find this breed anywhere in the world.

            The name chow chow is not of Chinese origin, it is of English origin. 
            
            When English sailors bought merchandise to sell in their country at the end of the 18th century 
            
            (porcelain figures, ivory pieces, jewels ...) they used a term to refer to all this type of trifle. 
            
            A ship captain preferred to write "chow chow" to list all the various objects that they brought inside the boxes. 
            
            Then they began to import dogs among their merchandise and over time the expression came to include the dog.

            The Dalmatian is a breed of dog that owes its name to the historic region of Dalmatia . Its main characteristic is its unique black, liver or lemon mottled coat. At birth, the young lack spots, which appear throughout their bodies during the first year of life. The hyperuricemia is common among Dalmatians, so often considered the only mammals uricotelic . Another trait of genetic origin typical of the breed is its high predisposition to deafness .
            
            It accompanied horse carriages serving as a guard dog, making it the traditional dog of firefighters and stables. It has also been employed as a shepherd and in war-related occupations. During the Regency Period it was used in England to keep the carriages of the aristocracy company, as it was a status symbol for the nobility for a dog of this type to run alongside the horses that pulled their carriage. Starting with the film 101 Dalmatians by Disney , in 1961, its popularity increased.

            It was recognized as a breed in the 19th century, although its heritage dates back a few thousand years before that of the original spaniel. The name comes from the old French "espaigneul", which means "Spanish dog" in reference to the country from which the original dogs (a breed of hunting dogs and game collectors) came from.
            
            Spaniel came to England with their Spanish owners and later some specimens were sold or given as gifts to English aristocrats to use on their farms. The increase in its popularity is reflected in the numerous references in English literature, such as works by Chaucer (XIV S) and Shakespeare (S XVI).

            The French bulldog is considered a small- sized molosser. Its beginnings are in England, with the English bulldog, its closest relative, a descendant of the mastiff- type breeds. And like all Bulldogs, its origin dates back to the molosos in the region of Epirus in Greece and the Roman Empire.
            
            It is likely that this breed is the result of various crosses between toy bulldogs from Great Britain and various local dogs. Descendant of the French bulldogs and the English bulldog (much heavier), it is the result of successive crosses that breeders from the popular neighborhoods of Paris made at the end of the 19th century in order to obtain an agile and athletic breed to make good watchdogs.
            
            Initially the French bulldog was a dog of the people, having as masters the butchers and coachmen, later it became part of high society and the artistic world, due to its original appearance and its unique character, spreading rapidly.
